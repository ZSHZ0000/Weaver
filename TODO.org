* List of TODO stuff for Weaver

** TODO Make it work.
We have the reader & printer working appropiately, we are still missing:
- Dynamically allocated environments, currently we're using a single environment
  for all our stuff.
- Add looping constructs.
- Anonymous functions.

** TODO Garbage collector.
We need this, currently we can only allocate a fixed amount of objects.
- I've been looking at garbage collectors & I believe mark-region collectors may
  be a reasonable choice for this application, through a generational mark-sweep
  couldn't be bad, it's simple enough & performs better than a normal mark-sweep
  algorithm.

** TODO Clean up the source code.
It is very messy.
- We could attempt to unify the main obarray with a hashtable type implementation
  (we do not have such type yet).
- Replace all 0 returns with error handling & proper values.
- Long string support (only short strings are currently supported).
- The allocation code seem to be bloated, it could likely be split apart into
  different files.

** TODO Restructure source code.
The way it is laid out is messy.
- Clean up ~alloc.c~, it currently has some stuff that could otherwise go into
  other file, like the Lisp interface for the cons objects.

** TODO Error handling.
This will without a doubt catch in flames if you look at it wrong.

** TODO Standard library.
This one is needed for actually useful stuff.

** TODO Macros?
This may be considered since it is a Lisp & such languages can benefit largely
from macros.

** DONE Give it a definitive name.
Weaver.

** TODO Implement a virtual machine & a compiler accordingly.
This is certainly ambitious yet something we may need in order to make this
an actual usable implementation.

** TODO Multithreading primitives.
This one is a must for actual applications.
