* List of TODO stuff for [Current Project Name]

** TODO Make it work.
We have the reader & printer working appropiately, we are still missing:
- The evaluator.
- Environments.
- Obarray (interned symbols).
- Long strings (only short strings are currently supported).

** TODO Garbage collector.
We need this, currently we can only allocate a fixed amount of objects.

** TODO Clean up the source code.
It is very messy.

** TODO Restructure source code.
The way it is laid ou is messy.

** TODO Error handling.
This will without a doubt catch in flames if you look at it wrong.

** TODO Standard library.
This one is needed for actually useful stuff.

** TODO Macros?
This may be considered since it is a Lisp & such languages can benefit largely
from macros.

** TODO Give it a definitive name.
I got no good name for it.

** TODO Implement a virtual machine & a compiler accordingly.
This is certainly ambitious yet something we may need in order to make this
an actual usable implementation.

** TODO Multithreading primitives.
This one is a must for actual applications.
